## About :speech_balloon:

Challenge from the Fullstack Developer Bootcamp at <a href="https://geekshubsacademy.com/">GeeksHubs Academy</a> where we have to create the frontend for a dental clinic.

The purpose of this design is to recreate the frontend part of our Dental Clinic. 

In this website you could register as a dentist or as a client and then login or logout. 

If you are a dentist you could see your profile, find all the active clinics, view your schedule in the last month or update your information. 

If you are a client you could view all dentists and clinics, create a new appointment, modify or delete it and finally you could also modify your personal information if you need.

This Project has been done by [Jos√© Luis Aparicio](https://github.com/ApcarJo), [Alejandro Urbina](https://github.com/2020-JAUG) and [Adriana Fayos](https://github.com/AdrianaFayos). 

Starting date: June 8th 2021. <br>
Due date: June 20th 2021.

We have used the Trello in order to share the tasks and to have a better organization.
